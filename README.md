#  JFSD Assessment project 04

Title: JFSD java project 04
This is the third development project. This time using java.

Description:
 
This project uses Java to enhance the codebase with additional requirement.
 

●	What did you like about this project?

 Java is totally new to me. I am able to practise my newly acquired skill in Java to make code enhancement.
 
●	What did you struggle with in this project?
    
    There are still bugs in the instantiation of classes. This is not as expected.
    More time is needed to debug. 
   
    It requires more reading in order to understand about java class instantiation and its proper uses. 

●	What would make your experience with this assessment better?

If more time were given, it would be better for me to debug and find out the cause of the issue causing the bugs.
